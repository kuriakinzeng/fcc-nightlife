# Free Code Camp's Nightlife Coordination App Basecamp Challenge

**tl;dr:** Nightlife Coordination App allows users to see how many people are going to bars near them

## User Stories:
1. As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
2. As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
3. As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
4. As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

## Architecture
The app is built on Express with Pug as templating engine. It uses [hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) as a boilerplate.

## Run locally
```npm install && npm run dev```

## Deploy to AWS
